# Kubernetes Ramp-up

## Welcome

A long, long time ago in a land not so far away, all programs on a computer lived together. They shared the same resources and privileges. If they were lucky, the operating system assigned CPU time fairly to each task. If they weren’t so lucky, they’d have to wait for competing tasks to give way.

Some tasks demanded root privileges, whether they deserved them or not. Others had arcane dependencies. Crucially, for us as developers, a framework, library, or tool would often demand a dependency that was incompatible with the version required by some other framework, library, or tool that we needed elsewhere.

These were dark times, friend.

Then came a solution. Containers and orchestrators.

This ramp-up is presented with a theoretical and a practical component that will help to undestand what is kubernetes, why is it useful, why people is using kubernetes in the industry, how is kubernetes componed and how does it works. We highly recomend that if you don't know about containers, learn about it first before coming to this rampup.
