# Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster

This chapter objective is to deploy the kubernetes cluster that will be used in the next steps of the rampup application. Is important to deploy a cluster from scratch since this will give more undestanding of where are the applications deployed, which are my nodes, how do kubernetes manages those nodes and distributes pods across those nodes. 

For completing this chapter you'll need to show your deployed cluster. This can be done in th cloud using a kubernetes cloud service as EKS in AWS or AKS in Azure; or it can be deployed locally on a virtual machine using mini-kube, both options are valid.

For deploying a local cluster for testing purposes using minikube, we recommend to follow this video from minute 34:47 to 1:02:03
